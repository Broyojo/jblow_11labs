# Elevenlabs API Multiple Speaker WAV from text file

I'm not saying that this is bug free (I made it in 15 minutes with some help from Claude 3.5 Sonnet) but it should work as a demo.

Here's how to run it:

```
$ python3 main.py dialogue.txt -m speaker_map.json
```

Here is a [demo audio](dialogue_output.wav).
